/**Functions in javascript 
 * Functions are the main building blocks of the progra.
 * We've already seen examples of built-in functions,like "alert(message)"
 * But wecan create fuctions of our own as well.
 * 
 * Therefore in javascript , functions  are blocks of code that ca be defined and caleed to perform a specific task.
 * 
 * FUNCTION DECLARATIONS
 * Function declarations define a ne=amed function using the function keyword.
 * 
 * Syntax
 * 
 *       function functionname(){
 *          
 *         }
*/
        //examples
        function showMessage(){
            alert("Hello Everyone")
        }


/**
 * In the example above , The function keyword goes first then goes the name of the function
 * then a list of parameters between the parenthesis (comma-separated,empty in the example above ,we'll see examples later)
 * and finally the code of function , also named " the function body",between curly braces.
 * 
 *     function name (parameter1,parameter2,.....parametern){
 *       //body
 *       }
 * 
 * -> In the example above to display the message"Hello Everyone" we just have to call the function  name as seen below
